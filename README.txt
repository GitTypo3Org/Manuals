TYPO3 documentation repository
===============================

What is it?
This repository hosts some of TYPO3s core documentation files.
For easier browsing, check the corresponding Forge project
http://forge.typo3.org/projects/typo3v4-documentation
and its subprojects.

Whom should I send documentation changes/additions?
There's a Forge bug tracker for each manual. Report changes
and errors there.

What are the text files used for?
Every SXW file has a corresponding text file. It should always reflect
the latest version of the SXW file it belongs to. This is very useful
because txt files can be used for comparing changes while binary SXW
files can't.

How can I create txt files from an SXW file?
Just choose "Save as..." in OpenOffice.org and select "Text (coded)" as
output format. Select UTF-8 encoding and Unix line endings.

Where are these documents published?
You can view these files online at the "Documentation" section at
http://typo3.org/.
Additionally, you can find PDF versions of these documents in the doc/
directory of the appropriate TYPO3 extensions (also available via this
SVN repository).

Where can I find older versions of these documents?
Have a look at the appropriate tags in the different repositories.
